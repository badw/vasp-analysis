# vasp-analysis
This is mostly an area for me (BADW) to learn python - but also make something useful out of it.

###setup

simply run:
``` 
git clone git@github.com:badw/vasp-analysis.git

cd ./vasp-analysis

pip3 install --user .
```
## parabo
this should hopefully give you:

a) a table of cell parameters:

* a,b,c
* alpha,beta,gamma
* volume

b) a list of bond lengths (in Ã…)

simply run:
```
parabo (-f POSCARFILE)
```
options for:

* changing the cutoff distance for the bond lengths with `-c` (current cutoff is 4 Angstroms)
* changing the accuracy to the next decimal place with `-d`
* output data as `.csv` with `-x` to easily import into Microsoft Excel ([Excel]/Data/Text to Columns)
* output the data into a latex table format with `-l` 


#### Acknowledgements:

`parabo` uses pymatgen, numpy and pandas

> #### TODO:

> - [ ] get bond lengths of a specific atom
> - [ ] compare multiple systems side by side
> - [ ] Plot data (of multiple systems) 

> tidyup:
> - [ ] make nicer LaTEX tables
